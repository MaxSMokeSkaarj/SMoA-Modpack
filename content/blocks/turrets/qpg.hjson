  '''
  Effects on quantum physics from phase fabric is magnified by amethysts and then pulsed outwards to slow enemies.
  Particle shifting at quantum levels also makes it deal a little damage.
  As a side effect, it also appears to weaken enemies as well.

  Has no effect on blocks, but will still try anyways because Anuke didn't add an off switch.

  Jesus Christ I wrote an entire paragraph.
